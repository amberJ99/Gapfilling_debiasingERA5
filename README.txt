GF_evaluation
-----------------------------------------------------
Note to myself: use virtual environment 'GF_evaluation_3'
-----------------------------------------------------

The different python files consist functions to:
	- perform GF, with separate techniques or with the algorithm
	- evaluate the GF with help of a complete dataset
	- visualize the results

This folder consists of following python files:
- Execution_read_NoviSad
	To read in and process the NoviSad data
- Execution_read_Turku
	To read iin an dprocess the Turku data
- Execution_test_GFalgorithm
	To perform the evaluation of the GF algorithm
- Execution_test_GFparameters
	To perform the evaluation of the different selection parameters of the MB debiasing technique in function of gaplength
- Execution_test_GFtechniques
	To perform the evaluation of the GF techniques next to each other in function of gaplength
- (Get_coordinates_ERA5)
	???
- (GF_algorithm)
	Functions to perform the GF algorithm
- (GF_algorithm_evaluation)
	Functions to perform the evaluation of the GF algorithm
- (GF_evaluation)
	Functions to perform the evaluation of the GF techniques
- (GF_parameters_evaluation)
	Functions to perform the evaluation of the selection parameters
- (GF_techniques)
	Functions to perform the GF techniques
- (Read_file)
	Functions to read in files
- (Test)
	???

Files with () are files with the definition of functions. Files with "Execution" are files that are run to perform the evaluations, and will use functions defined in the other files.
